# Git Practice Repository

This is a dummy repository created for practicing Git commands as part of the SSC0535 - Software Configuration Management, Maintenance and Evolution course at the University of São Paulo (USP).

## Project Description

This repository contains a simple C program that implements recursive and iterative functions to calculate:
- Summation (somatória) of numbers from x to y
- Product (produtória) of numbers from x to y

The program demonstrates basic C programming concepts and recursive function implementations.

## Features

- Iterative summation function
- Recursive summation function
- Recursive product function
- User input handling
- Formatted output

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C compiler (gcc recommended)
- Git

### Compilation

```bash
gcc main.c -o program
```

### Running the Program

```bash
./program
```

## Development History

The project was developed incrementally with the following major milestones:

1. Initial repository setup with basic README
2. Creation of main.c with basic structure
3. Implementation of iterative summation function
4. Addition of recursive summation function
5. Implementation of recursive product function
6. Code formatting and final adjustments

Each commit represents a significant step in the development process, demonstrating proper version control practices.

### Branching Strategy

The development process utilized Git branches to manage feature development:

- `main`: The main branch containing the stable version of the code
- `produtoria`: A feature branch created for implementing the recursive product function

This branching strategy demonstrates the practice of:
- Keeping the main branch stable
- Developing new features in separate branches
- Merging completed features back into the main branch

## Course Context

This repository is part of the practical exercises for SSC0535 - Software Configuration Management, Maintenance and Evolution, where students learn and practice:
- Git version control
- Repository management
- Branching and merging
- Collaborative development practices
